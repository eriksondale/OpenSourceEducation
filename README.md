I'm a strong believer in education being free. Regardless of who you are or where you come from, you should be able to learn what you want.

Below are resources I have curated for learning different topics related to STEM. I will add more classes, books, videos, etc. as I find them! As always, it is a continual work in progress.

If any links are broken, let me know by messaging me or submitting a request! Thanks!
