# OpenSourceEducation
I'm a strong believer in education being free. Regardless of who you are or where you come from, you should be able to learn what you want. 

Below are great resources for learning different topics related to chemistry, biology, mathematics, or computer science. I have personally found them helpful/entertaining and I hope you will too!
